# Commands
`!fate` : Print the commands.... y'know. This.

`!r [argument]` : Given a dice string, like `3d6`, roll a specified number of dice of a type. No need to include `1` for single die. You can add bonuses or penalties with `-` and `+` after the quantity/type string.

`!gr [argument]` : the same as `!r`, but will be whispered to the author for a "hidden" roll. Typically used for GMs

`!srd` : Posts a link to the online SRD for Pathfinder.

`!e [argument]` : Sends a formatted "ENCOUNTER" text block to the log, in order to help break up text between encounters in your server

`!g [argument]` : The same as `!e` , but for "GRANTED" - as in, granting items or experience

## Examples 
`!r d20`: roll 1 d20.

`!r 2d20`: roll 2 d20s.

`!r 1d6+2`: roll 1d6, adding a bonus of 2.

And so on.
